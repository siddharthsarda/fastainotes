.## Getting started

The core of this lesson is just getting comfortable with Kaggle notebooks, `fastai` library and basic introduction to Machine Learning.

We work through a toy problem where we try to guess if an image is a forest or a bird based on an XKCD comic. Most of the takeaways for me were around how to setup a machine learning problem and solve it using `fastai`. `fastai` fwiw is basically a wrapper over pytorch.

### Key Takeaways

I think since the code is in a notebook, its useful to put it all together in one place:

```
from duckduckgo_search import ddg_images
from fastcore.all import *

def search_images(term, max_images=30):
    print(f"Searching for '{term}'")
    return L(ddg_images(term, max_results=max_images)).itemgot('image')

urls = search_images('bird photos', max_images=1)

searches = 'forest','bird'
path = Path('bird_or_not')
from time import sleep

for o in searches:
    dest = (path/o)
    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} photo'))
    sleep(10)  # Pause between searches to avoid over-loading server
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} sun photo'))
    sleep(10)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} shade photo'))
    sleep(10)
    resize_images(path/o, max_size=400, dest=path/o)
failed = verify_images(get_image_files(path))
failed.map(Path.unlink)
len(failed)
```
So far all of this is just getting the dataset,cleaning it etc. etc.


Now for the interesting part, 
```
dls = DataBlock(
    #(blocks first specifies input and then output)
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), 
    get_items=get_image_files, 
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.3, seed=42),
    get_y=parent_label,
    item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]
).dataloaders(path, bs=32)

dls.show_batch(max_n=6)

learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(3)
``` 

DataLoaders is an object that contains the training set and the validation set and is passed along to the algorithms. `vision_learner` presumably because this is an image problem.
`resnet18` is a widely used computer vision model and is good for mostly all things you want to do. The `fastai` library integrates a deep learning library called `timm` (https://timm.fast.ai/)
which is a collection of a lot of computer vision models. 

Also when you I run the above code you see something like `Downloading:"https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth"`. Its because resnet18 has already been trained on the ImageNet dataset.
So you start off with those weights and then `fine_tune` method of fast.ai adjusts them in a very controlled way to perform best on my dataset.

This can be used for segmentation (filling in images), tabular data and collaborative filtering as well.


### A general intuition for what's happening
Our neural network gets a set of inputs and weights, prodcues some results and calculates the loss. Then it uses the loss to update weights and come up with a better set of weights which makes the loss smaller. This is a general equation which works for most mathematical problems( I vaguely remember the mathematical problem has to have certain properties for this to be true but maybe we will hear about this later in the lesson).
